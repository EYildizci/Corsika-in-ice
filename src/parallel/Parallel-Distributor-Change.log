v0.5 26-04-11 by Gevorg Poghosyan (SCC@KIT) and Jurgen Oehlschlaeger (IKP@KIT)
-many bug fixing
-consolidation of outputs, no more subfolders/subdirectories will be used
-reducing unnecessary checks of Runnumbers
-implementing the preprocessor for generation of ready2run packages to start simulations for given steering input file

v0.4  01-06-11 by Sushant Sharma (Internship at SCC@KIT)
-Implementing Book-Keeping for runs on local Linux Shells
-Modification to get rid of 'generation type simulation'.

v0.3  24-11-10 by Gevorg Poghosyan (SCC@KIT)
-Implementing the new option for type of job submitter
-Local runs in linux shell as default

v0.2  19-06-10 by Himani Singla, Shenan Kalra (Internship in SCC@KIT)
 -Adding statistic for job runing time

 v0.1  10-05-10 by Himani Singla, Shenan Kalra (Internship in SCC@KIT)

Main Algorithmic steps:
1.the run number entered in steering input file will be checked
2.submitting of initial run will be made using corsika-initial.TYPE.sh
3.secondary input files will be created by running corsika-secondary.sh
4.submitting of secondary simulations corsika-secoandary.TYPE.sh to be used 

ToDo: 
-Additional scripts for more job distributor types: PBS,Grid,BOINC 
-mpiid regulation to escape conflicts with previous runs in same folder  
-definition of limits dependng on scheduling systems of computing systems, e.g. maximal possible number of jobs in queue
